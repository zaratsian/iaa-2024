## Assignment #1 - Distributed SQL

Please submit the code and answers to me at d.zaratsian@gmail.com as a notebook, script, Google Doc, or whatever method you prefer. I'd prefer for you to answer these questions using [Google BigQuery (free Sandbox version)](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) so that you get used to this Serverless Cloud Data Warehouse. If that doesn't work, then you can use SparkSQL within [Google Colab Notebooks](https://colab.sandbox.google.com) or the docker container environment that I provide below. Here's my [starter Colab notebook](pyspark_sql.ipynb) to get you up and running. If for some reason those methods do not work, then you may use a different approach, but please specify your approach as part of your response.

Use the San Francisco Bike sharing data to answer the following questions. There are two ways to access the data:

**Option #1 - Use Google BigQuery**: You can query the data directly in [Google Cloud BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) using a syntax such as this:

```
# NOTE: Remove the limit for you analysis
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` LIMIT 10
```

```
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_station_info`
```

**Option #2 - Use Google Colab (or, if needed, a local notebook environment)**: Download the files from here [bikesharing_trips.csv](bikeshare_trips.csv) and [bikesharing_stations.csv](bikeshare_station_info.csv)

**Option #3 - Use a Docker container**: You can choose a container of your choice, but here's the process I'd take to deploy a containerized environment with Jupyter notebooks and Pyspark SQL installed:
```
docker pull jupyter/pyspark-notebook
docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/pyspark-notebook
# Then open up a browser and go to URL specified in your shell
```

## **Questions:**

1. Which bike station in San Francisco is the most popular starting point?


2. Which routes are the most popular? Please list the top 5. A route is a defined as a (start_station_name, end_station_name).


3. Which stations are the furthest distance apart? Hint: If you're using BigQuery, I'd recommend calculating the distance in meters based on the longitude and latitude of the start and end points ([reference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions)). Please provide the top 5 stations furthest apart.
